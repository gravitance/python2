EX 76 : PRIME FACTORS

The prime factorization of an integer, n, can be determined using the following steps:

Initialize factor to two

While factor is less than or equal to n do

    If n is evenly divisible by factor then

        Conclude that factor is a factor of n

        Divide n by factor using integer division

    Else

        Increase factor by one

Write a program that reads an integer from the user. If the value entered by the
user is less than 2 then your program should display an appropriate error message.
Otherwise your program should display the prime numbers that can be multiplied
together to compute n, with one factor appearing on each line. For example:

'''

n = int(input("Enter an integer (more than 2): "))

if n < 2:
    print("Integer must be more than 2.")

else:
    factor = 2

    while factor <= n:
        if n % factor == 0:
            print(factor)
            n = n//factor
        
        else:
            factor += 1
